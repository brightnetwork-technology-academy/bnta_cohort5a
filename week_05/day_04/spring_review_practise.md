# Spring Review & Practise

Your task today is to review the concepts we covered this morning and to create your own simple Spring project which generates a valid JSON array response to a HTTP GET request.

## Review

> Before you start, please ensure that you are no longer running a server from this morning's codealong!

Review the lessons from this morning by reading over the relevant sections of the Textbook:
- [HTTP: CRUD over the web](https://brightnetwork-technology-academy.github.io/curriculum/java/days-13-14-16/http/)
- [Intro to Spring Boot](https://brightnetwork-technology-academy.github.io/curriculum/java/days-13-14-16/spring-boot/)
- [Spring Boot: REST API part I](https://brightnetwork-technology-academy.github.io/curriculum/java/days-13-14-16/rest-api/)

# Practise
Use the tutorial in [Spring Boot: REST API part I](https://brightnetwork-technology-academy.github.io/curriculum/java/days-13-14-16/rest-api/) to create your own project, from scratch, that outputs a valid response to a Get request. 

You will need to:
- generate a project from [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/)
- add the correct dependency (Spring Web)
- create a controller
- Annotate it correctly and output something (an array of Strings) on that route
